# Chain-reaction
This is a repository for a game known chain reaction written on the C language with some graphics and some sound so run only in Turbo C

*reference only*

Using Graphics header library in Turbo C.
Note This code wont show output in DevC++ as it does  not include Graphics.h library itself. While Turbo C does. It had 3 Logic scenarios 
- One considering the corner which reacts to its 2 edges

- Second, on the edge where the it reacts with 2 corner and one in the field inside

- In the middle where it multiplies to 4 directions each.

So we had 3 ssuch conditions and hence it involves medium level complexity and some basic Mathematics.
The code Seems big but definity its not that complex to learn
